        I've recently became aware of this prominent principle that runs in the back-end of human psychie. It's called the Scarcity Loop, a device that humans in the past relied on to survive, but is now being used against us for the worst. Let me explain.
        <br /><br />
        The scarcity loop is broken down into 3 key components: Repeatibility, Opportunity, and Unexpected Rewards. Game developers have long been taking advantage of this device, and successful games all capture the essence of the scaracity. Think of games like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and Vampire Survivors. The opportunity is to rank/level up, the unexpected reward is the chance to win or lose, and the repeatability is how

        {`It's been less than a week since I've started on this project. I don't have a concrete name for it yet. Nor have I decided what kind of experience I want to deliver. Should I make it single player or co-op? Maybe an MMORPG? How should I let the player discover the world? What kind of story do I want to tell? What's the lore? Do I want a light-heart atmostphere or a serious theme? What art style? What kind of music? What kind of combat system? What kind of progression system? What kind of ...??`}

        {`I want to make a game that I would play. i think it's the only way I would want to continue development. A game that toes the balance of casual and hardcore, that rewards exploration and experimentation. A game that people look forward to spending their time in after a day of work. I already know that this will be a long-term committment. And making it right will be hard. I've already hit several technical walls.`}

        {`There is so much to do. And so much to learn. This is the type of project that builds on past experience and pushes every single boundary. A project that demands time, attention, and care. This is new territory. And I can't wait to explore more of it.`}
