            {`I typically don't like to write about something this intimate and private. Whenever I did, I would cringe at it hours later and delete it. But the more I deeper I thought about why I have such an adversion to showing vulnerability, the less it made sense. I mean, I don't cringe at other people for crying their hearts out. I think it's a subconscious part of me that wants to bury that feeling and avoid the memory of it completely. But not this time. What I feel in the moment is completely valid, and if I don't leave some sort of record of it, I'm afraid I might just close myself off completely.`}

            {`My father is an angry time bomb, waiting to be set off. The slightest wrong nudge can set him off into an emotionally abusive state. He's the quintessential example of someone with anger management issues, and less than an hour ago I had been on the receiving end of such outburst.`}
            <br /><br />
            {`His beratement consists of reminding me that I am a completely worthless child, for a duration ranging from 10 minutes to hours. His state of anger can last for hours to days, depending on the 'offense' committed. Today that offense is forgetting to bring the headshot photo for my passport renewal, and we had to drive back 10 minutes to retrieve it. This ticked him off for the entire car ride, and he let me know it. In his mother tounge, I was called a retard, a bastard child, a talentless sack of shit, unmotivated, game addict, deadbeat, and a variety of other creative ways to remind me of my worthlessness.`}

            {`You know, they say time heals all wounds, and I firmly believe that. After a period of calm, I unconsciously start forgiving his wrongdoings. I'm the type of person that believes any person can change. But to prevent myself from getting hurt, maybe I should reframe that thinking. A person has the ability to change if they are willing, but I don't think my father has ever had the conscious thought to change that behavior of his. I think the root of most of my mental blocks are caused by his treatment. My imposter syndrome, my critical image of myself, my inability to relax without feeling guilt, my overthinking of social interactions. My only thoughts before college was to be free free free of being in the terrible home that my father dwells. And after scenarios like these those past emotions boil inside my heart again, telling me to get as far as possible away away from him.`}
            <br /><br />
            {`His words today bring me to a realization: his image of me is still the same when I was a child. He still thinks that I am addicted to games, that I spend all my time on the computer wasting time. The reality is that he hasn't made an attempt to conenct with me for years, and I'm left feeling stupid trying to reconnect with him. This is a one-way relationship, and a meaningless pursuit at best. People say you learn to forgive your parents and become more grateful when you become an adult. For my own sake, I think I need to start excluding people from that list.`}
