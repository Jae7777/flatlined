          I used to have bios pre-written for the purpose of autofilling queries like these. I stopped writing them because I realized that I outgrow them every couple of weeks. The self-described me in those descriptions no longer represent who I am today. Now I just write whatever comes off the top of my head.
          <br /> <br />
          I am a jack of all trades. I can code in pretty much any language. I can make websites using simple web builders like Wix or Wordpress to more complicated frameworks like Next.js and Svelte. I can develop games using Godot, Pygame, and Unity. I can train an AI model using TensorFlow to detect when you are sitting with bad posture (looking at you).
          <br /> <br />
          I am also not limited to programming. I know how to use Affinity and Canva to manipulate designs and photos. I can write scores using Musescore and produce a song in FL Studio. I can edit and render videos and films using DaVinci Resolve. I can squat and dead lift 225lbs for 8 reps and run a mile afterwards.
          <br /> <br />
          I can do all of these things. And that ever-growing list of things is the reason why bios like these get rewritten. And it's a good thing. Every new bio is symbolic of a new me that has gained something since the last one. It represents my dynamic growth and ability to adapt. And one day I want to have contributed something that truly <span className='text-cyberviolet'>mattered,</span>, for someone, to someone.
